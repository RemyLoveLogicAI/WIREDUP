## Overview

This directory groups the documentation-oriented source code, runnable example(s), and automated tests that together illustrate and validate multi-agent or swarm orchestration behavior. At the root there are no standalone documentation files; instead, content is organized into subdirectories. The src/ subdirectory contains the documentation-facing package code (including a root __init__.py) and references an agents package that provides swarm orchestration components. The examples/ subdirectory holds practical example scripts, currently a single multi_agent.py that demonstrates multi-agent behavior. The tests/ subdirectory contains automated tests, currently test_swarm_orchestrator.py, intended to validate the swarm orchestrator component.

Collectively, these components provide a small documentation ecosystem: src/ contains the package-level documentation code and initialization, examples/ gives concrete usage patterns for developers to run and study, and tests/ offers validation and regression checks for the orchestrator behavior. This layout keeps runnable examples and tests adjacent to the documentation-facing source so developers can trace examples back to the package implementation and verify behavior using the included test(s).


### File Organization

Contents are organized by role: src/ for the documentation package source and package initialization, examples/ for runnable demonstration scripts (multi_agent.py), and tests/ for automated tests (test_swarm_orchestrator.py). No files reside at the _docs root; the hierarchy groups related artifacts to make their intent explicit (implementation vs example vs test).

## 📂 Subdirectories

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

### [📁 examples](./examples/README.md)

**Purpose:** Holds example scripts demonstrating usage patterns; currently contains a single example script for multi-agent behavior.

### [📁 src](./src/README.md)

**Purpose:** Holds source-level documentation package code and package initialization for this part of the repository, and references an agents package containing swarm orchestration components.

![Files: 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Files-1-blue)

---

### [📁 tests](./tests/README.md)

**Purpose:** Contains test code for validating repository components; serves as the location for automated tests associated with this project.

## Architecture Notes

- The directory intentionally separates documentation-facing source (src/), runnable examples (examples/), and automated tests (tests/) to keep concerns isolated and traceable.
- The src/ package references an agents package that contains swarm orchestration components, indicating the documentation package surfaces or ties into orchestration functionality rather than reimplementing it.
