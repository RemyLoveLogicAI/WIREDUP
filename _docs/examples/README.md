## Overview

This directory contains example code intended to demonstrate usage patterns for the project. At the root level there is a single Python example script, multi_agent.py. The listed file does not include an explicit documented purpose in the provided metadata, so this directory serves as the canonical location for runnable example(s) that illustrate features or integrations of the larger system.

There are no subdirectories documented for this folder. Together, the contents of this directory are meant to be consumed by developers as reference material: read the example(s) to understand typical invocation and expected behavior, and adapt patterns into application code as needed. Because only one file is present and its internal details were not specified in the provided context, this README intentionally keeps descriptions high-level and directs developers to open multi_agent.py first to learn specifics about what is demonstrated and how it fits into the broader codebase.


### File Organization

Files are organized flat at the directory root. Each file represents a standalone example script. This keeps example code easy to find and run; additional examples (if added) should follow the same flat layout and be named clearly to indicate their focus.

## 📂 All Files

| File | Type |
| --- | --- |
| [multi_agent.py](./multi_agent.py.md) | 🐍 Python |

## Architecture Notes

- This directory follows a flat layout where each file is an independent example script. No additional architectural patterns are evident from the provided metadata.
