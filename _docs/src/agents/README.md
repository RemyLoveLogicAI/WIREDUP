## Overview

This directory provides the Python package boundary and the primary swarm orchestration module for agent-related functionality. At the root level it contains an __init__.py file which establishes the agents package namespace and any package-level exports or initialization behavior, and a swarm_orchestrator.py module which implements the orchestration logic for agent swarms (module-level orchestration responsibilities are indicated by the filename). These two files together form the functional surface of the agents package.

There are no subdirectories contained under this path. The components at the root work together by exposing the package (via __init__.py) and implementing core orchestration behaviors in swarm_orchestrator.py. In the larger system this directory acts as the focused implementation location for agent orchestration: other parts of the codebase import from agents to access orchestration functionality and any package-level convenience exports provided by the initializer.


### File Organization

Files are organized flat at the package root: __init__.py establishes the package and swarm_orchestrator.py contains the main module for orchestration. This keeps agent-related code centralized and easy to import as a single package.

## 📂 All Files

| File | Type |
| --- | --- |
| [__init__.py](./__init__.py.md) | 🐍 Python |
| [swarm_orchestrator.py](./swarm_orchestrator.py.md) | 🐍 Python |

## Architecture Notes

- The directory is organized as a single-package module: __init__.py defines the package boundary and swarm_orchestrator.py implements the core functionality.
- Keeping a flat layout simplifies imports for consumers of the agents package.
