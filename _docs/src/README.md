## Overview

This directory contains the code files that make up the documentation-facing source package. At the root level there is a single __init__.py file; the explicit purpose of this root-level file was not provided in the input context, so its exact initialization or export behavior is not specified here.

There is one subdirectory, agents/, which provides the package boundary and the primary swarm orchestration module for agent-related functionality. The agents/ directory contains its own __init__.py to establish the agents package namespace and to expose package-level exports or initialization behavior, and a swarm orchestration module that implements the swarm-related behavior. Together, the root-level files and the agents/ subpackage form the documentation source area that groups package initialization and agent orchestration code under a single directory, allowing the larger system to import the agents package from this location when needed.


### File Organization

A small hierarchical layout: a root package file (__init__.py) at this directory level and a dedicated subpackage (agents/) for agent-related modules. This groups package initialization at the top level while isolating agent implementation and orchestration into its own package directory.

## 📂 Subdirectories

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

### [📁 agents](./agents/README.md)

**Purpose:** Contains the agent-related Python modules for this package, exposing an agents package initializer and a swarm orchestration module.

## Architecture Notes

- The directory separates package initialization (root-level __init__.py and agents/__init__.py) from implementation by placing agent-specific modules inside the agents subpackage.
- The agents subpackage is explicitly described as containing the primary swarm orchestration module, indicating a focused responsibility for agent orchestration within this directory.
