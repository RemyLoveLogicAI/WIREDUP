## Overview

This directory contains the test files present at the root of the directory. At the time of indexing there is a single test file: test_swarm_orchestrator.py. The provided file name indicates it is intended to hold tests related to a "swarm orchestrator" component, but no further purpose details were supplied in the input context.

There are no subdirectories listed under this directory. The directory functions as a flat test corpus (one file) used to verify behavior of parts of the codebase. Because only one file is present and no explicit purposes or dependencies were provided, this README intentionally sticks to describing the file that exists and how developers should approach it when exploring or extending tests in this folder.


### File Organization

All test files are placed at the root of this directory. Currently there is a single test file (test_swarm_orchestrator.py). The flat structure keeps tests centralized and easy to find; add additional test modules alongside the existing file following the same naming convention.

## 📂 All Files

| File | Type |
| --- | --- |
| [test_swarm_orchestrator.py](./test_swarm_orchestrator.py.md) | 🐍 Python |

## Architecture Notes

- The directory uses a flat organization with test modules placed at the root level.
- Only one test file is present; additional tests should follow the naming pattern and be colocated here.
